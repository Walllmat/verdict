## 📋 What is verdict?

verdict is a plugin designed to evaluate code quality using several criteria. It works with Claude Code and helps users see how well the code meets certain standards. The plugin supports custom rules and automatic checks. It also includes a simple command to judge any code snippet.

The main points of verdict are:

- Scores code in seven areas: correctness, completeness, adherence, efficiency, safety, plus two more.
- Allows you to set your own scoring rules or use the default ones.
- Stops execution when the code quality drops below your set limits.
- Automatically runs quality checks at certain points.
- Lets you run quick manual judgment with a simple command.

This makes verdict a helpful tool to make sure your code stays good and error-free.
