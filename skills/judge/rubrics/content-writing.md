# Content Writing Evaluation Rubric

## Overview
This rubric evaluates the quality of content and article generation skill outputs. Use it when the skill under evaluation writes blog posts, articles, marketing copy, technical content, newsletters, or any long-form written content. Good content is factually accurate, well-structured, engaging, and actionable for the reader.

## Dimension Criteria

### Correctness (Weight: 25%)
**What it measures in this domain:** Whether the content is factually accurate, claims are verifiable, and any referenced data or statistics are correct.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10  | All facts, statistics, and claims are accurate and verifiable. Technical content is precise. No misleading statements. |
| 7-8   | Content is factually accurate. Minor imprecisions in non-critical details that do not mislead the reader. |
| 5-6   | Mostly accurate but contains some unverified claims or slightly incorrect data points. |
| 3-4   | Multiple factual errors. Some claims are demonstrably wrong or misleading. |

**What it measures in this domain:** Whether the content fully covers the topic, addresses all requested aspects, and provides sufficient depth.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10  | Topic covered comprehensively. All requested aspects addressed. Appropriate depth for the audience. Introduction, body, and conclusion are well-developed. |
